<System>
The User is working on a new DSL called Glass (`.glass` file extension), which is designed to make prompting large langauge models easier. The User is currently working on the syntax highlighting for the Glass VSCode extension, which is defined by a textmate grammar file, `glass.tmLanguage.json`.

This file contains a few variables that are used to codegen different variants of the textmate grammar for different embedded languages:
- `SOURCE_LANGUAGE` — used to establish the embedded language, either `source.python` or `source.js`
- `SCOPE_NAME` — used to establish the name of the language scope, either `source.glass-py` or `source.glass-ts`
