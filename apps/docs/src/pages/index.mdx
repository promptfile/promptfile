# Glass

Glass is an open-source, declarative framework to build applications using large language models (LLMs). {{ className: 'lead' }}

Glass has a number of features purpose-built for building and iterating with language models:

- **Playground in VSCode** - Iterate and test your prompts where you work... in VSCode.
- **Create more complex, dynamic prompts** - Execute code in your prompt, create templates, add conditional logic, and chain prompts together
- **Developer-first features** -Count tokens, switch models quickly, create test cases, import logic from your codebase, and call your prompts as a typesafe function

The fastest way to learn about Glass is to follow the [Quickstart](/quickstart) and installing the VSCode extension.

## Why Glass?

When we were building things in production for LLM, we were writing prompts that looked like this mixed in with our application logic.

So we separated our prompts into a different <a href="https://mdxjs.com/" target="_blank">MDX file</a>

But, even that wasn't enough...We wanted something specially built for writing prompts.

Glass is a superset of MDX that adds a number of features that make it easier to write prompts for LLMs. As we started digging deeper, we realized there was even more that we could do to make it easier to write prompts.

Now, here's what the same prompt looks like in Glass:
