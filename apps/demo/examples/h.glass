// Many interesting applications of AI technology involve loading information dynamically (e.g. from an API) and giving the LLM access to this data.

// In this example, let's load the raw HTML from the personal website of Elliott Burris.
// We can fetch the raw HTML and inject it into the prompt — the LLM can use this HTML to answer questions

// Be sure to `await` any async calls!

const res = await fetch('https://elliottburris.com')
const html = await res.text()
