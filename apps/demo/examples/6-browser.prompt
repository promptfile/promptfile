Many interesting applications of AI technology involve loading information dynamically (e.g. from an API) and giving the LLM access to this data.

In this example, let's load the raw HTML from the personal website of one of the creators of Promptfile.
We can fetch the raw HTML and inject it into the prompt — the LLM can use this HTML to answer questions

Be sure to `await` any async calls!
<Code>
const res = await fetch('https://elliottburris.com')
const html = await res.text()
</Code>

now we can use `html` in our prompt!

Your job is to answer questions based on the following website.
