// Anthropic actually doesn't support System blocks via their API, so switching to the
// `claude-instant-v1` model will trigger a diagnostic (aka "yellow squiggle").
//
// The file is still runnable! Glass will convert the document into a sensible prompt for whatever
// model you want to use, including non-chat models like GPT3 `text-davinci-003`.
//
// The Glass extension will guide you to use the models (and their varying APIs) correctly.
