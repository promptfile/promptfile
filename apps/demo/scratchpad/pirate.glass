// This is a simple prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a pirate.
// The prompt is structured for chat use via the `System`, `Assistant`, and `User` blocks.

// we can actually execute Typescript as a Code block at the top of our Glass file.
// async works too — just be sure to await!
<Code>
const date = new Date()
const formattedDate = date.toISOString().split('T')[0]
</Code>


// first, add the instructions to the System prompt.
<System>
