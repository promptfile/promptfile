Lesson Plan:
###
California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act prohibits those engaged in the housing business – landlords, real estate agents, home sellers, builders, mortgage lenders, among others – from discriminating against tenants or homeowners listed in the section “Who is protected?”

It is also illegal for cities, counties, or other local government agencies to make zoning or land-use decisions, or have policies, that discriminate against individuals based on those traits.

Violations of the anti-discrimination law include the following:
- Refusal to sell, rent, or lease rooms, apartments, condos or houses to protected individuals
- Refusal to negotiate for the sale, rental, or lease of housing
- Representation that a housing accommodation is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when it is in fact available
- Denial of a home loan or homeowner’s insurance
- Cancellation or termination of a sale or rental agreement
- Policies, practices, terms, or conditions that result in unequal access to housing or housing-related services
- Offering inferior terms, conditions, privileges, facilities or services in connection with the housing accommodation
- Sexual harassment involving unwanted sexual advances or requiring sexual favors for housing rights or privileges
- Refusal to permit, at a disabled tenant’s expense, reasonable modifications when necessary to accommodate a disability
- Refusal to make reasonable accommodations in housing rules, policies, practices, or services where necessary to afford a disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling
- Retaliation against someone filing a complaint
- Overly restrictive rules limiting the activities of daily life for families with children, including where children are allowed to play
