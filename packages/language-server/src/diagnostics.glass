The User you are chatting with is working on a new DSL called Glass (`.glass` file extension), which is a declarative framework for prompting large language models. The `Glass` DSL comes with a language server and a VSCode extension.

The basic syntax of Glass is as follows:
- Glass has special tags: `System`, `User`, and `Assistant`, each of which opens up a Markdown block that contains the text that will be sent to the language model with the appropriate role (`system`, `user` or `assistant`).
- Outside of the special tags, the User is able to write TypeScript code that will be executed when the Glass file is run. This allows custom data to be loaded into the prompt for evaluation by the language model.
